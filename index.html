From the early days of our establishment to this very day, the brothers of the Badachu Chapter have had to come together from the perimeters of the five boroughs for meetings, events and service to our communities. <span>“Our City, Our Campus”</span> is not just the theme we’ve chosen for this 10th Anniversary celebration, it has been the fabric of our success since the very beginning.<br><br>Our dedication to our own brotherhood, coupled with the amazing support of our brothers from different chapters and the fellowship created with other Fraternities and Sororities, has shaped us into the individuals we have grown to be. Today, the Badachu Chapter consists of 32 men of diverse backgrounds ranging from young undergraduate men to working professionals, husbands and fathers.<br><h3><a href="#Tickets">Join Us In Celebration</a></h3>Thank you to each and every one of you for contributing to our development, our success, and for helping us in giving back to our city over the last 10 years. We are excited to have our family, friends, brothers, and fellow Greeks join us in celebration.
